# LinkedIn Post for Zodic

🚀 **Excited to announce the launch of Zodic - A TypeScript Zod-inspired validation library for Python!** 

After months of development, I'm thrilled to share Zodic with the Python community. If you've ever used Zod in TypeScript and wished for the same elegant API in Python, this is for you!

## 🔥 **What makes Zodic special:**

✅ **Intuitive chainable API** - Just like TypeScript Zod
✅ **Lightning-fast performance** - 2M+ operations/second
✅ **Zero dependencies** - Lightweight and reliable
✅ **Excellent type safety** - Full IDE support with autocompletion
✅ **Comprehensive error reporting** - Detailed nested path errors
✅ **56 comprehensive tests** - 85% code coverage

## 💡 **Quick example:**

```python
import zodic as z

# Simple validation
user_schema = z.object({
    "name": z.string().min(1).max(100),
    "age": z.number().int().min(0).max(120),
    "email": z.string().optional(),
    "is_active": z.boolean().default(True)
})

user = user_schema.parse({
    "name": "Alice Johnson", 
    "age": 30,
    "email": "alice@example.com"
})
# Returns: {"name": "Alice Johnson", "age": 30, "email": "alice@example.com", "is_active": True}
```

## 🎯 **Why I built this:**

Coming from TypeScript development, I always missed Zod's elegant validation API when working with Python. While Pydantic is excellent, I wanted something lighter, faster, and with that familiar chainable syntax that makes validation code so readable.

## 📦 **Get started:**

```bash
pip install zodic
```

- **Real-world use cases** to improve the API

Special thanks to the TypeScript Zod team for the inspiration and the Python community for the amazing ecosystem that makes projects like this possible!
